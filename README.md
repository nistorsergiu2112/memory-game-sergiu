# Sergiu's Memory Game Project

This is my second project i did for Udacity, and my first one in Javascript!

## About the game

This is a classic Memory Game, made up of 16 shuffled cards.

## How to play:

-The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

-Start by clicking on one card. 

-If they match, they will remain with face up.

-If they don't, they will flip and you will have to search for the ones that do match.

-Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up.

## Game elements:


-You can notice on the top side that you have a star rating ( ranging from 3 to 1 star )

-You also have moves counter and a timer.

-At the end of the game, a window will pop that will display your stats and 2 buttons that

can be pressed to Replay the game or Close the window.
